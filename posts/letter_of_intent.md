## Letter of intent
_2023-05-18_

One big hurdle for non-tech people to be their own bank is `security`.
Dont get me wrong, traditional finance is not safer by any definition, but it has built in functionality to block/revert transactions. Whether or not a few institutions should wield that power i leave unsaid.  

I have been working in the security sector for a while, specializing in `malware analysis/reverse engineering`. I want to give back to the community by providing insights into different threat actors and the techniques they are using. Contrary to popular belief, threat actors in this space very rarely `hack` anyone. They simply do not have the skills necessary. Instead, they specialize in tricking users into either giving up information, or, in lack of a better word, hacking themselves.

An overwhelming majority of users who loses funds due to scammers/hackers could easily have prevented it if they just stopped to think for a second. 
It is really easy for me to just write that here, but hopefully over the course of time i'll have earned your trust and learned you something.

*small disclamer* I will show malicous code on this site with hopes of spreading understanding. Often in my proffesional life i get angry comments like: 
Why do you share the code?? That just makes it easier for someone else to copy it and do malicous things to other people!!
`no.` Most of what i'll show you is not some ancient witchcraft that only a handful of elite hackers know. There are several hundred thousand code repos available to anyone to use, if you just google it. If i show you how they work, i might be able to get you to understand what to look out for.
